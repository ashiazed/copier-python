# {{ project_name }}

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) + [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Bootstrap the environment

```bash
make bootstrap
```

This installs `pre-commit` hooks and locks dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

## Usage

Start the dev container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app bash
```

Inside the container:

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

## Lint and format manually

```bash
make format
make lint
make typecheck
```

## CI

GitHub Actions will:

- Install with `uv`
- Run lint, type checks, and tests
